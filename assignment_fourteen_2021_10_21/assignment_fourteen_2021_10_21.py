# 1. A set is an unordered collection with the same interface as a bag.
# However, the items in a set are unique, whereas a bag can contain
# duplicate items. Define a new class named ArraySet that implements
# an array-based set type. The add method simply ignores the item if itâ€™s already in the set. 

# 2. Write Python program that will allow a professor to maintain a list of
# students for a given course. The program should contain a basic Student
# class with attributes for the first name, last name and test score. Write
# the basic __init__, __str__ methods and get and set methods for the attributes.
# the program should also have Course class. Course should have two attributes a 
# name and an ArraySet (from part 1) of students registered for the course.
# The constructor for the Course class should create a Course object with a
# name and empty set of students. The Course class should have methods to add
# a student and to drop a student. When a student is added to a class its test 
# score is assigned value None. Write method to assign a test score to a particular
# student and a method to compute and return the average test grade for the entire
# curse. If, there is at least one student with score None the method should raise a
# ValueError. Finally, write the main program that will allow professor to manage a course.
# Please, notice that you need to write an actual main program that user can interact with
# not just tester for your classes.
