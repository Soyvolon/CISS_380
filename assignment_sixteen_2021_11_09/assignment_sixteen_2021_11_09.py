# 1. Complete and test the (singly)linked and array implementations of stack 
# data structure. as discussed in class. Just like in assignment 15, combine
# stack interface, abstract stack and abstract collection classes into one 
# AbstractStack class (that is this class needs to have ABC class as parent). 

# 2. Your textbook writes about using stack to convert expression from infix into 
# postfix form. Write Python program that will convert infix expression into prefix 
# (Polish) form. You should use the algorithm presented on this website
# https://www.javatpoint.com/convert-infix-to-prefix-notation

# infix:    a + b
# postfix:  a b +
# prefix:   + a b
# infix:    (a + b) * c
# postfix:  a b + c *
# prefix:   * c + a b
# infix:    a + b * c
# postfix:  a b c * +
# prefix:   + * b c a
