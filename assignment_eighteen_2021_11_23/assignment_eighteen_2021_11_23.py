# Complete the code for LinkedList class in the form described in
# textbook using doubly linked nodes and with dummy head node. 
# Combine the code from AbstractCollection and AbstractList classes 
# into one AbstractList class, that is really abstract, that is it 
# derives from ABC and contains abstract methods. 

# Also complete and test code for LinkedListIterator that is different 
# than the ArrayListIterator, like the textbook describes it is possible 
# to implement iterator methods efficiently (that is O(1) time complexity). 
# Attached you will find the file for LinkedListIterator class with one method implemented.
